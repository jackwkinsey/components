# Exaptive Components

This repository contains open source versions of popular Exaptive components that are able to be run outside of the Exaptive platform. 

Functionality is maintained wherever possible. Input ports are replaced by constructors and methods, and output ports are replaced by methods that can be inspected and triggered events that can be extended.

Instructions for using particular components are included in the relevant source and example files.
